# Interactive LED Matrix with Auto Control

##  Project Idea
An interactive LED Matrix game controlled by a push button (digital input) and a sound sensor (analog input).  
You can turn the matrix ON or OFF with a long press, show a random emoji with a single press, or display an emoji based on sound intensity with a double press.

## Components
- Arduino UNO  
- MAX7219 4-in-1 LED Matrix  
- Push Button (digital input)  
- KY-038 Sound Sensor (analog input)  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper Wires (Male-to-Male & Male-to-Female)  

## What is an LED Matrix?
An **LED Matrix** is a grid of LEDs arranged in rows and columns, allowing you to display text, numbers, symbols, and animations by controlling individual LEDs.  
In this project, we use a **MAX7219 4-in-1** module (32x8 pixels) for creating interactive visual displays.

###  1. Installing the LedControl Library
1. Open **Arduino IDE**.  
2. Go to `Sketch` â†’ `Include Library` â†’ `Manage Libraries...`.  
3. Search for **LedControl** and install it (by Eberhard Fahle).  
4. Add to your code:  
   ```cpp
   #include <LedControl.h>

###  2. Creating LED Matrix Patterns
- Use the online tool [LED Matrix Editor](https://xantorohara.github.io/led-matrix-editor/) to draw your design.  
- Copy the generated hex values and paste them into your Arduino code as a byte array.

#### Example Patterns
Here are some example patterns that include digit, letters, and signs.

### 3. Wiring the LED Matrix to Arduino UNO
| MAX7219 Pin | Arduino UNO Pin |
|-------------|-----------------|
| VCC         | 5V              |
| GND         | GND             |
| DIN         | D12             |
| CS          | D10             |
| CLK         | D11             |

## What is a Sound Sensor?
KY-038 is a simple microphone module. In this project we use the **analog output (AO)** to measure sound intensity (0â€“1023).  
> Note: The **DO** pin is digital (HIGH/LOW with an internal comparator). We **donâ€™t** use it here.

#### Wiring (KY-038 â†’ Arduino UNO)
| KY-038 Pin | Arduino Pin |
|------------|-------------|
| VCC        | 5V          |
| GND        | GND         |
| AO         | A0          |

## Demo â€“ How the Game Works
The demo below shows how the game operates using the LED Matrix, push button, and sound sensor.  

- Long press â†’ Turns the matrix ON or OFF.  
- Single press â†’ Displays a random emoji.  
- Double press â†’ Measures sound intensity for 3 seconds, then shows an emoji based on the detected sound level.
